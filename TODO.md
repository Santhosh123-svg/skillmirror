# Deployment Tasks for Render

- [x] Update client/src/api/api.js to prefix API routes with '/api'
- [x] Update server/src/app.js to serve static files from client build and add catch-all route for SPA
- [x] Update server/package.json to add build script for client
- [x] Update root package.json to add build and start scripts for deployment
- [x] Test the deployment setup locally if possible (build successful, server requires DB for full test)
